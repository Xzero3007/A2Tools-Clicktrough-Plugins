# Armory

Your AION 2 character as NC's official character pages show it, with every
value written out (no hovering), and what to do next.

- **Overview**: the gear score taken apart (item levels, enhance levels,
  Amplify, Manastones, Theostones, Daevanion points), checked against the
  game's own number; the Daevanion boards (points spent of all); titles with
  their stats; pet and wings.
- **Stats**: the deity stats round a wheel and the base stats inside, each
  with what its points give; and **what each stat does**, every one your
  character has (from deity stats, gear, Manastones, titles, Daevanion), in
  the game's own words (Double Chance, Perfect, Endurance, Penetration, the
  caps ...), with where yours come from, and a short "In short" of how they
  work together; or every stat the game has.
- **Gear**: each piece with its enhance and Amplify level, item level, its
  stats and what the enhance level adds, sub stats, Manastones (and empty
  slots), Theostones, the extra skill levels it gives, and its next step:
  chance, the chance a failure adds, Kinah and materials a try.
- **Soul binding**: each piece's soul binding, what it has (every value and
  where it lies in its range) and the properties you want on it, picked from
  a list of what that piece can get (the stats with their ranges, your
  class's skill effects, each one's chance to be the first pick). For the
  wanted ones: ✓ or ✗, and the chance a new binding gives them all (counted
  exactly from the game's weights), also on the reference's piece when it
  takes more. **Top players' picks** fills a piece with what the strongest
  players of your class have on it most. The picks are kept per character,
  apart from the references.
- **Skills**: a target level for each skill you raise, picked from a list
  (or the reference's levels, or the median of the strongest players of your
  class); the others fold away. Each level split into skill points (to 10),
  Daevanion (to 14: one node on each of the first four boards) and gear and
  Arcana (the rest), and the way to the target: skill points, the cheapest
  Daevanion nodes still closed (board, grade, points), the levels gear and
  Arcana must give and where the strongest players have theirs from.
- **Daevanion**: every offensive stat of the boards (Attack, Accuracy,
  Critical Hit, Combat Speed, Cooldown, Penetration, the Boosts, Multi-hit,
  Perfect and Double), what is open and what is still closed, on which board;
  PvE and bosses, PvP or both. A board's map (offensive nodes gold, skill
  levels purple, open filled, closed with their points), its closed offensive
  nodes nearest first, and the cheapest way to any node (a node opens next to
  an open one, side by side), with what the nodes on the way give. Its
  closed skill level nodes, with your targets.
- **Reference**: builds to compare with and aim at, from questlog.gg. The
  **Armory bookmark** (its code is in the Reference tab: a bookmark you make
  once in your browser) saves the builds of the questlog.gg character build
  page open as a file, from the page's own state: every build of that
  character with its gear and levels, soul bindings, Manastones, Theostones,
  Arcana and their skills, the Daevanion build's nodes on every board and the
  skill build's levels and specializations. Pick the file in the Armory and
  choose the builds to keep (nothing is fetched from questlog.gg; the
  bookmark reads the page in your browser and sends nothing). A build page
  saved from the browser (Ctrl+S) is still read too (items, levels, points).
  Several references can be kept; the one picked is compared with
  everywhere: slot by slot yours against it (with its soul bindings), skills
  with its specializations, Daevanion points, deity stats; its gear score
  from items, levels, stones, Arcana and Daevanion points. In **Soul
  binding** its properties per piece (**Take**, or for every piece without
  picks), in **Skills** its levels as targets, in **Daevanion** its total per
  offensive stat, its nodes on the map, and per board what it takes that you
  haven't and what you took that it leaves. **Edit** changes a slot (any item
  by name, its levels); **Code** shows the reference as text, to keep or
  move.
- **Goals**: a target gear score (or combat power, by an estimate), and the
  cheapest enhance and Amplify steps on the gear you wear to get there, each
  with its Kinah on average and 9 times in 10, and the materials: Enhance
  Stones, Amplify Stones (in Kinah at your server's market price), bound
  scrolls. What the gear can't give: Daevanion points still open, empty
  Manastone slots, the reference's better pieces.
- **History**: every reading kept when something changed (combat power,
  gear score, gear, skills, Daevanion, titles), with a chart; while you play,
  the game's own combat power and gear score as they change.

The character you play is read by itself (when its last reading is older
than 6 hours); **Update** reads it again. **Look up** finds anyone by name in
a shard.

## Where it comes from

- **Characters**: NC's AION 2 character pages (aion2.plaync.com, the
  official site's character info, and its character search), read through
  the meter (`a2.web.get`, the meter's patch 0032), pictures through
  `a2.web.image` from the game's icon server (assets.playnccdn.com) and NC's
  portraits. Nothing is sent but the lookup itself (a name, or a server and
  a character's id); no account, no sign-in. NC's page is behind the game
  until it updates; the header shows the game's own numbers beside it.
- **The gear score**: the game's Item Level from its parts, found on 24
  characters and exact for every one: a piece's item level and enhance level
  (Arcana too), 5 an Amplify level, Manastones 1 to 4 and Theostones 3 or 5 by
  grade, 1 a Daevanion point (a node costs 1 to 4 by grade). Titles don't
  count.
- **Enhancing**: the game's own enhance (Enchant) and Amplify tables and
  every enhanceable item, read from AION 2's files by
  [Aion2Data](https://aion2data.com) (unofficial; `dev/make_data.py` builds
  `data.js` from its calculator's data file). Game data belongs to NCSOFT.
  Average tries count the chance a failure adds; a step that loses a level on
  failure (the Clash Rune) counts the climb back. Enhancement Supplements are
  not counted.
- **What the stats do**: the game's own stat descriptions, from its files as
  Aion2Data's stats page lists them (`dev/make_data.py` reads them too).
- **Soul binding**: what each item's soul binding can give (its stats with
  ranges and weights, the skill effects by class, how many) is the game's item
  data, taken from questlog.gg's item database (`dev/make_data.py
  --questlog`), with the names of its stat and skill ids, the Arcana cards,
  and a Manastone's and Theostone's grade (to read a build's). A binding picks one property after another, never one twice;
  the stats share 80 % of a pick and the skill effects 20 %, as Aion2Data
  reads NCSOFT's probability notice.
- **The strongest players**: the characters of a class on Shugo.GG's combat
  power leaderboard of Global (its top 100), read from NC's character pages
  by `dev/top_players.py` and counted: per piece the soul binding properties
  and items they have, per skill its median level and where the extra levels
  come from. Only the counts go into `data.js`, no names. Read for Rangers on
  2026-10-28 (36 characters); other classes: run it with their names.
- **Prices**: aion2.exchange's market prices of your server, from the fork's
  hourly copy (the Market's).
- **Combat power**: NC doesn't publish its formula. The goal's combat power
  is an estimate: from your own history once it has two changes, before that
  about 52 a gear score point (24 characters of all strengths, 2026-10-28).

## Data

```bash
python3 -I dev/top_players.py <cache folder>/top ranger [--fetch]   # the strongest players, counted
python3 -I dev/make_data.py <cache folder> --fetch [--questlog <probe file>]   # writes data.js
bash dev/ci.sh ../ct-src                                             # the tests
```

The cache folder holds NC's pages of the characters read: keep it out of
the repo.
